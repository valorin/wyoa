**WYOA**, *"Write Your Own Adventure"*, is a collaborative *choose your own adventure*
story that allows you to continue to tell the story in your own way when you
run out of pages. It is also distributed, allowing you to download and install
your own *book* on your own web server, as well as linking between each book
to create a truely epic adventure.

It started it's life back in 2003 as **DTAG** (Decision Tree Adventure Generator),
written by Jason Patterson. Stephen Rees-Carter took it over and maintained
it in a number of forms until WYOA was born as an Open Source distributed version.

WYOA is powered by **ZF2** and the project can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/valorin/wyoa) where you can download & fork it.
